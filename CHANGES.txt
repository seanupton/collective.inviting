Changelog
=========

0.2 (unreleased)
----------------

- plone.app.event support: message view uses ulocalized_time from 
  plone.app.event, not from Products.CMFPlone -- this is because there
  is a DateTime.strftime bug affecting ulocalized_time(), and a workaround
  exists in plone.app.event.base.ulocalized_time (using strftime() from
  datetime.datetime() in a new instance of a DateTime subclass).  This
  is only used when plone.app.event is available.

- plone.app.event support: fix rsvp view for compatibility (use getuid()
  for validation, view proxy for template macros).
  [seanupton]

  [seanupton]

  event_view in plone.app.event based contexts required definition
